# Skateboard

## Self-Driving Skateboard
The initial inspiration for this project was the concept of a self-driving skateboard. In the time during development, I became busy and as such only completed the non-skateboard portion. However the idea behind the project also shifted. Currently, the Python script reads data from the camera controlled by the Arduino and powers the linear actuators accordingly.

## BoardSkeleton
Pictures of the wiring which would have to be attached to the board (self-taught prototyping, please don't laugh :) ).

## testingCam
Script written in Arduino dev environment to control the Arduino Uno I used for this project. Sends data via byte through the serial system to the waiting Python script.

## main.py
Python script which interprets camera feed.
